Software architecture diagrams and notes.
- Data flow: Sensor → ESP32 → LoRa → Gateway → MQTT → Cloud → Dashboard
- Publish-subscribe model for real-time alerts

Data Flow Architecture (ASCII Art):

Bin Sensor --> ESP32 (Process Fill Level) --> LoRa Transmit
   |
   v
LoRa Gateway --> Internet (MQTT Publish) --> Cloud (AWS/Thingsboard)
   |
   v
Cloud Processing (Store in DB, Analyze) --> Dashboard (Grafana/Node-RED)
   |
   v
Alerts & Routes --> Mobile App / Email (for Authorities/Drivers)

Protocols: LoRa for edge, MQTT for cloud integration.
Justification: MQTT is lightweight, supports pub/sub for real-time updates.
